# Getting started with C++
## Why do it?
`C++` is generally known as a old language, and for this reason there is a small set of programmers who understimate this beautiful language. This article is going to show you how powerful, fast, optimized, and especially fresh `C++` can become if you know how to take advantage of each `C++` feature, and even with a basic knowledge you can begin to be aware of a lot of abstract processes that will help you in your program optimization or even help you if you want to work with a low level development. Anyway, whatever is your purpose, i am sure that ```C++``` will help you!
## The features in a nutschell
#### Learn how your computer works
As i told you, one of the better ```C++``` features is just his complexity, which invites you to know how your computer works, from memory management to call conventions, you can understand how your computer works and how it performs each process. You can also use that knowledge to optimize your program, and not only that, you can apply your knowledge to any programming language, because not only are you learning about ```C++``` development, but you are learning and improving your own programming logic!
#### Control and speed
With ```C++``` you can control each instructions and well design your code, this enchance the speed of your program and it is the reason because many companies are using C++ in the core of their projects.
#### Get support from many companies
Many companies are betting on ```C++``` for his features, and are giving many resources for the progress of ```C++```. Companies like Google, for example, are continuously supporting the ```C++``` community, with guides, open source codes and even free software projects, driving to many developers to move to ```C++```. Do you know that a big part of Google Chrome is programmed on ```C++```? Like many Chromium projects. ```C++``` is ever a good selection!
#### A very active comunity
```C++``` has a very active community of developers, writers, and people that continuously are support the ```C++``` development. You just need to type ```"C++"``` on Google and you will see the big quantity of development resources, like books, whole web sites, courses, forums, and so. Even there are whole IRC channels for ```C++```, like ```C++ basic```, ```C++ standard```, ```C++```, ```social C++```, and a LOT more!
#### C++ is fresh (and will continue to be)
Every day the ```C++``` development community is working hard for offer to ```C++``` programmers a fresh language, with a lot of useful features in each standard versions. One of the most important facts is that generaly in each update of the ```C++``` standard there are two elements updates, a update to the language core and a update to the standard libraries, each one with his own new features. Generaly, an update is more trascendent that what it seems to be. For example, ```C``` has just functions, ```C++``` has function objects, ```C++11``` has lambda functions and ```C++14``` has generic lambda functions, and consider that this is just an example in all the possible examples.
#### A well-paid language
```C++``` is not just a good programming language, but for the same reason, it one of the most paid programming languages, and it is even above ```Java```, ```Python```, ```Javascript``` and those set of popular programming languages by some surveys. If you want to learn a good language, and also want to get money, ```C++``` is one of the best options, i am sure that you will not regret it.
## Conclusion
I invite you to learn ```C++```, again, I am sure that you will not regret it and get a lot of skills from this beautiful, powerful, and fast language. ```C++``` is not just a low level programming language, it is also one of the best general-purpose programming language selections. On this web site you can find a serie of resources about ```C++``` programming. And without more to say for today:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    while(true)
    {
    	std::cout << "Enjoy your learning!" << std::endl;
    }
	return 0;
}
```
